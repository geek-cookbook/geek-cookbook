# Paperless NGX

Paper is a nightmare. Environmental issues aside, there‚Äôs no excuse for it in the 21st century. It takes up space, collects dust, doesn‚Äôt support any form of a search feature, indexing is tedious, it‚Äôs heavy and prone to damage & loss. [^1] Paperless NGX will OCR, index, and store data about your documents so they are easy to search and view, unlike that hulking metal file cabinet you have in your office.

!!! question "What's this fork üç¥ thing about, and is it Paperless, Paperless-NG, or Paperless-NGX?"
    It's now.. Paperless-NGX. Paperless-ngx is a fork of paperless-ng, which itself was a fork of paperless. As I understand it, the original "forker" of paperless to paperless-ng has "gone dark", and [stopped communicating](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1599), so while all are hopeful that he's OK and just busy/distracted, the [community formed paperless-ngx](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632) to carry on development work under a shared responsibility model. To save some typing though, we'll just call it "Paperless", although you'll note belowe that we're using the linuxserver paperless-ngx image. (Also, if you use the automated tooling in the Premix Repo, Ansible *really* doesn't like the hypen!)

## {{ page.meta.recipe }} Requirements

--8<-- "recipe-standard-ingredients.md"

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

We'll need a folder to store a docker-compose configuration file and an associated environment file. If you're following my filesystem layout, create `/var/data/config/paperless` (*for the config*). We'll also need to create `/var/data/paperless` and a few subdirectories (*for the metadata*). Lastly, we need a directory for the database backups to reside in as well.

```bash
mkdir /var/data/config/paperless
mkdir /var/data/paperless
mkdir /var/data/paperless/consume
mkdir /var/data/paperless/data
mkdir /var/data/paperless/export
mkdir /var/data/paperless/media
mkdir /var/data/runtime/paperless/pgdata
mkdir /var/data/paperless/database-dump
```

### Create environment

To stay consistent with the other recipes, we'll create a file to store environment variables in. There's more than 1 service in this stack, but we'll only create one one environment file that will be used by the web server (more on this later).

```bash
cat << EOF > /var/data/config/paperless/paperless.env
PAPERLESS_TIME_ZONE:<timezone>
PAPERLESS_ADMIN_USER=<admin_user>
PAPERLESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password>
PAPERLESS_ADMIN_MAIL=<admin_email>
PAPERLESS_REDIS=redis://broker:6379
PAPERLESS_DBHOST=db
PAPERLESS_TIKA_ENABLED=1
PAPERLESS_TIKA_GOTENBERG_ENDPOINT=http://gotenberg:3000
PAPERLESS_TIKA_ENDPOINT=http://tika:9998
EOF
```

You'll need to replace some of the text in the snippet above:

* `<timezone>` - Replace with an entry from [the timezone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (eg: America/New_York)
* `<admin_user>` - Username of the superuser account that will be created on first run. Without this and the *&lt;admin_password&gt;* you won't be able to log into Paperless
* `<admin_password>` - Password of the superuser account above.
* `<admin_email>` - Email address of the superuser account above.

### {{ page.meta.recipe }} Docker Swarm config

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like the following example:

--8<-- "premix-cta.md"

```yaml
version: "3.2"
services:
  
  broker:
    image: redis:6.0
    networks:
      - internal

      - /var/data/paperless/data:/usr/src/paperless/data
      - /var/data/paperless/media:/usr/src/paperless/media
      - /var/data/paperless/export:/usr/src/paperless/export
      - /var/data/paperless/consume:/usr/src/paperless/consume
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      labels:
        # traefik
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.docker.network=traefik_public

        # traefikv1
        - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:paperless.example.com
        - traefik.port=8000    
        - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.address=http://traefik-forward-auth:4181
        - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.authResponseHeaders=X-Forwarded-User
        - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.trustForwardHeader=true        

        # traefikv2
        - "traefik.http.routers.paperless.rule=Host(`paperless.example.com`)"
        - "traefik.http.routers.paperless.entrypoints=https"
        - "traefik.http.services.paperless.loadbalancer.server.port=8000"
        - "traefik.http.routers.paperless.middlewares=forward-auth"
    networks:
      - internal
      - traefik_public

  gotenberg:
    image: thecodingmachine/gotenberg
    environment:
      DISABLE_GOOGLE_CHROME: 1
    networks:
      - internal

  tika:
    image: apache/tika
    networks:

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - /var/data/runtime/paperless/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: paperless
      POSTGRES_USER: paperless
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: paperless
    networks:
      - internal
  
  db-backup:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - /var/data/paperless/database-dump:/dump
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    environment:
      PGHOST: db
      PGDATABASE: paperless
      PGUSER: paperless
      PGPASSWORD: paperless
      BACKUP_NUM_KEEP: 7
      BACKUP_FREQUENCY: 1d
    entrypoint: |
      bash -c 'bash -s <<EOF
      trap "break;exit" SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM
      sleep 2m
      while /bin/true; do
        pg_dump -Fc > /dump/dump_\`date +%d-%m-%Y"_"%H_%M_%S\`.psql
        (ls -t /dump/dump*.psql|head -n $$BACKUP_NUM_KEEP;ls /dump/dump*.psql)|sort|uniq -u|xargs rm -- {}
        sleep $$BACKUP_FREQUENCY
      done
      EOF'
    networks:
    - internal

networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true
  internal:
    driver: overlay
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.16.58.0/24 

```

You'll notice that there are several items under "services" in this stack. Let's take a look at what each one does:

* broker - Redis server that other services use to share data
* webserver - The UI that you will use to add and view documents, edit document metadata, and configure the application settings.
* gotenburg - Tool that facilitates converting MS Office documents, HTML, Markdown and other document types to PDF
* tika - The OCR engine that extracts text from image-only documents
* db - PostgreSQL database engine to store metadata for all the documents. [^2]
* db-backup - Service to dump the PostgreSQL database to a backup file on disk once per day

## Serving

Launch the paperless stack by running ```docker stack deploy paperless -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```. You can then log in with the username and password that you specified in the environment variables file above.

Head over to the [Paperless documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com) to see how to configure and use the application then revel in the fact you can now search all your scanned documents to to your heart's content.

[^1]: Taken directly from [Paperless documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com)
[^2]: This particular stack configuration was chosen because it includes a "real" database in PostgreSQL versus the more lightweight SQLite database. After all, if you go to the trouble of scanning and importing a pile of documents, you want to know the database is robust enough to keep your data safe.
