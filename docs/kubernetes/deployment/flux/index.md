title: Using flux for deployment in Kubernetes

# Deployment

In a break from tradition, the flux design is best understood *after* installing it, so this section makes the most sense read in the following order:

1. [Install](/kubernetes/deployment/flux/install/)
2. [Design](/kubernetes/deployment/flux/design/)
3. [Operate](/kubernetes/deployment/flux/operate/)
