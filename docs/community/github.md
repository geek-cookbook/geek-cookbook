# How to geek on GitHub

Any changes to the cookbook start as issues in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook).

## Report a bug

If you've found a bug with a recipe, [create a bug report](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/issues/new?assignees=funkypenguin&labels=bug&template=bug-report.yaml&title=%5Bbug+report%5D+). The issue template will walk you through the required information :)

## Request a recipe

What if you've got no bug to report, but you'd like to suggest a recipe? [Request a recipe](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/issues/new?assignees=&labels=recipe%2Frequest%2Cstatus%2Fbacklog%2Cgood+first+issue&template=recipe-request.yaml&title=%5Brecipe%5D+), and once again, you'll be prompted for the relevant details to start the process.

## Make a suggestion

What if you'd like to suggest a change, but it's not really a recipe or a bug? [Make a suggestion](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=suggestion.yaml&title=%5Bsuggestion%5D+)!

## Support Request

Actually, GitHub is **not** the place for support requests. I.e. if **your** implementation of a recipe isn't working, the places for support are:

- [Discord][community/discord]
- [Discourse][community/discourse]

## Contribute an improvment

The process of contributing improvements and fixes is best explained in details in our community [contribution guide](/community/contribute/) :thumbsup:
