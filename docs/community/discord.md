# Community Geeking out in Discord

Do you want to talk to somebody, stat!? Are you a fan of group messaging / chat platforms?

One of the most realtime and exciting way engage with our geeky community is in our [Discord server][community/discord] (*which is also synced with our [Matrix][community/matrix] and [Slack][community/slack] servers*)

!!! question "Eh? What's a Discord? Get off my lawn, young whippersnappers!!"
    Yeah, I know. I also thought Discord was just for the gamer kids, but it turns out it's great for a geeky community. Why? [Let me elucidate ya.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qHoSWxVqtE)..

    1. Native markdown for code blocks
    2. Drag-drop screenshots
    3. Costs nothing, no ads
    4. Mobile notifications are reliable, individual channels mutable, etc

    However, if Discord is not your thing, take a look at [Matrix][community/matrix] or [Slack][community/slack] ;)

## How do I join the Discord server?

1. Create [an account](https://discordapp.com)
2. [Join the geek party](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz)!
