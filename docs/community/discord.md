!!! question "Eh? What's a Discord? Get off my lawn, young whippersnappers!!"
    Yeah, I know. I also thought Discord was just for the gamer kids, but it turns out it's great for a geeky community. Why? [Let me elucidate ya.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qHoSWxVqtE)..

    1. Native markdown for code blocks
    2. Drag-drop screenshots
    3. Costs nothing, no ads
    4. Mobile notifications are reliable, individual channels mutable, etc

## How do I join the Discord server?

1. Create [an account](https://discordapp.com)
2. [Join the geek party](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz)!
