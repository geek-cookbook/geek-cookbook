# Toot me up, buttercup!

Mastondon is a self-hosted / open-source microblogging platform (*heavily inspired by Twitter*), which supports federation, rather than centralization. Like email, any user on any Mastodon instance can follow, "toot" (*not tweet!*), and reply to any user on any *other* instance.

Our community Mastodon server is sooo [FKNY](https://so.fnky.nz/web/directory), but if you're already using Mastodon on another server (*or your [own instance][mastodon]*), you can seamlessly interact with us from there too, thanks to the magic of federation!

!!! question "This is dumb, there's nobody here"

    * Give it time. The first time you get a federated reply from someone on another instance, it just "clicks" (*at least, it did for me*)
    * Follow some folks (I'm [funkypenguin@so.fnky.nz](https://so.fnky.nz/@funkypenguin))
    * Install [mobile client](https://joinmastodon.org/apps)

## How do I Mastodon?

1. If you're a [sponsor][github_sponsor], check the special `#mastodon` channel in [Discord][discord]. You'll find a super-sekrit invite URL which will get you setup *instantly*
2. If you're *not* a sponsor, go to [FNKY](https://so.fnky.nz), and request an invite (*invites must be approved to prevent abuse*) - mention your [Discord][discord] username in the "Why do you want to join?" question.
3. Start tootin'!

## So who do I follow?

That.. is tricky. There's no big-tech algorithm to suggest friends based on previously-collected browsing / tracking data, you'll have to build your "social graph" from the ground up, one "brick" at a time. Start by following [me](https://so.fnky.nz/@funkypenguin). Here are some more helpful links:
