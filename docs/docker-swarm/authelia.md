# Authelia in Docker Swarm

[Authelia](https://github.com/authelia/authelia) is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing 2-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. Like [Traefik Forward Auth][tfa], Authelia acts as a companion of reverse proxies like Nginx, [Traefik](/docker-swarm/traefik/), or HAProxy to let them know whether queries should pass through. Unauthenticated users are redirected to Authelia Sign-in portal instead. Authelia is a popular alternative to a heavyweight such as [KeyCloak][keycloak].

Features include

* Multiple two-factor methods such as
  * [Physical Security Key](https://www.authelia.com/docs/features/2fa/security-key) (Yubikey)
  * OTP using Google Authenticator
  * Mobile Notifications
* Lockout users after too many failed login attempts
* Highly Customizable Access Control using rules to match criteria such as subdomain, username, groups the user is in, and Network
* Authelia [Community](https://discord.authelia.com/) Support
* Full list of features can be viewed [here](https://www.authelia.com/)

## Authelia requirements

!!! summary "Ingredients"
    Already deployed:

    * [X] [Docker swarm cluster](/docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph/)
    * [X] [Traefik](/docker-swarm/traefik/) configured per design

    New:

    * [ ] DNS entry for your auth host (*"authelia.yourdomain.com" is a good choice*), pointed to your [keepalived](/docker-swarm/keepalived/) IP

### Setup data locations

First, we create a directory to hold the data which authelia will serve:

```bash
mkdir /var/data/config/authelia
```

### Create Authelia config file

Authelia configurations are defined in `/var/data/config/authelia/configuration.yml`. Some are required and some are optional. The following is a variation of the default example config file. Optional configuration settings can be viewed on in [Authelia's documentation](https://www.authelia.com/configuration/prologue/introduction/)

!!! warning
    Your variables may vary significantly from what's illustrated below, and it's best to read up and understand exactly what each option does.

1. The wildcard rule must go last, since the first rule to match the request, wins

### Create Authelia user Accounts

Create `/var/data/config/authelia/users_database.yml` this will be where we can create user accounts and give them groups

```yaml title="/var/data/config/authelia/users_database.yml"
# To create a hashed password you can run the following command:
# `docker run authelia/authelia:latest authelia hash-password YOUR_PASSWORD``
users:
  batman: # each new user should be defined in a dictionary like this
    displayname: "Batman"
    # replace this with your hashed password. This one, for the purposes of testing, is "password"
    password: "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$cW1adlh3UjhIRE9zSmZyZw$xA4S2X8BjE7LVb4NndJCZnoyHgON5w3FopO4vw5AQxE"
    email: batman@example.com
    groups:
      - admins
      - dev
```

To create a hashed password you can run the following command
`docker run authelia/authelia:latest authelia hash-password YOUR_PASSWORD`

### Authelia Docker Swarm config

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like the example below.. example:

--8<-- "premix-cta.md"

```yaml title="/var/data/config/authelia/authelia.yml"

```

1. Optionally used to test 1FA authentication
2. Optionally used to test 2FA authentication

!!! question "Why not just use Traefik Forward Auth?"
    While [Traefik Forward Auth][tfa] is a very lightweight, minimal authentication layer, which provides OIDC-based authentication, Authelia provides more features such as multiple methods of authentication (*Hardware, OTP, Email*), advanced rules, and push notifications.

## Run Authelia

Launch the Authelia stack by running ```docker stack deploy authelia -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

### Test Authelia

To test the service works successfully, try logging into Authelia itself first, as a user whose password you've setup in `/var/data/config/authelia/users_database.yml`.

You'll notice that upon successful login, you're requested to setup 2FA. If (*like me!*) you didn't configure an SMTP server, you can still setup 2FA (*TOTP or webauthn*), and the setup link email instructions should be found in `/var/data/config/authelia/notifications.txt`

Now you're ready to test 1FA and 2FA auth, against the two "whoami" services defined in the docker-compose file.

Try to access each in turn, and confirm that you're *not* prompted for 2FA on whoami-authelia-1fa, but you *are* prompted for 2FA on whoami-authelia-2fa! :thumbsup:

## Summary

What have we achieved? By adding a simple label to any service, we can secure any service behind our Authelia, with minimal processing / handling overhead, and benefit from the 1FA/2FA multi-layered features provided by Autheila.

!!! summary "Summary"
    Created:

    * [X] Authelia configured and available to provide a layer of authentication to other services deployed in the stack

### Authelia vs Keycloak

[KeyCloak][keycloak] is the "big daddy" of self-hosted authentication platforms - it has a beautiful GUI, and a very advanced and mature featureset. Like Authelia, KeyCloak can [use an LDAP server](/recipes/keycloak/authenticate-against-openldap/) as a backend, but *unlike* Authelia, KeyCloak allows for 2-way sync between that LDAP backend, meaning KeyCloak can be used to *create* and *update* the LDAP entries (*Authelia's is just a one-way LDAP lookup - you'll need another tool to actually administer your LDAP database*).

[^1]: The initial inclusion of Authelia was due to the efforts of @bencey in Discord (Thanks Ben!)
