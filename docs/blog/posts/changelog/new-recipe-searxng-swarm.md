# Added recipe for {{ page.meta.recipe }} (swarm)

SearXNG is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from more than 70 search services.

Users are neither tracked nor profiled. You can use one of the 100+ [public instances](https://searx.space/) (*including [ours](https://searxng.fnky.nz)*), or (*and really, this is why you're here, right?*) you can [run your own instance](https://docs.searxng.org/own-instance.html)
