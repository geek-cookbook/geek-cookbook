[Kavita Reader][kavita] is a "rocket fueled self-hosted digital library which supports a vast array of file formats". Primarily used for cosuming Manga (but quite capable of managing ebooks too), Kavita's killer feature is an OPDS server for integration with other mobile apps such as Chunky on iPad, and the ability to save your reading position across multiple devices.
