## Chef's notes 📓

///Footnotes Go Here///

### Tip your waiter (sponsor) 👏

Did you receive excellent service? Want to compliment the chef? (_..and support development of current and future recipes!_) Share a [review](https://fnky.nz/testimonial), sponsor me on [Github][github_sponsor] / [Patreon][patreon], or see the [contribute](/community/contribute/) page for more (_free or paid)_ ways to say thank you! 👏

### Employ your chef (engage) 🤝

Is this too much of a geeky PITA? Do you just want results, stat? [I do this for a living](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/about/) - I'm a full-time Kubernetes contractor, providing consulting and engineering expertise to businesses needing short-term, short-notice support in the cloud-native space, including AWS/Azure/GKE, Kubernetes, CI/CD and automation.
