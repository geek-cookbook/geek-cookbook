# Reviews of self-hosted apps

Unlike the [Docker Swarm](/docker-swarm/) or [Kubernetes](/kubernetes/) sections, which focus on deployment of various applications, this section reviews the applications themselves, irrespective of the deployment methodology.

What you'll find here are opinions and notes about various self-hosted applications, which will be updated from time-to-time to keep them "fresh" :leafy_green:
