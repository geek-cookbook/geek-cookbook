# Traefik Dashboard

One of the advantages [Traefik](/kubernetes/ingress/traefik/) offers over [Nginx](/kubernetes/ingress/nginx/), is a native dashboard available in the open-source version (*Nginx+, the commercially-supported version, also includes a dashboard*).

[^1]: The beauty of this design is that the same process will now work for any other application you deploy, without any additional manual effort for DNS or SSL setup!
