# Wildcard Certificate

Now that we have an [Issuer](/kubernetes/ssl-certificates/letsencrypt-issuers/) and the necessary credentials, we can create a wildcard certificate, which we can then feed to our [Ingresses](/kubernetes/ingress/).

!!! summary "Ingredients"

    * [x] A [Kubernetes cluster](/kubernetes/cluster/) 
    * [x] [Flux deployment process](/kubernetes/deployment/flux/) bootstrapped
    * [x] [Cert-Manager](/kubernetes/cert-manager/) deployed to request/renew certificates
    * [x] [LetsEncrypt ClusterIssuers](/kubernetes/ssl-certificates/letsencrypt-issuers/) created using DNS01 validation solvers

Certificates are Kubernetes secrets, and so are subject to the same limitations / RBAC controls as other secrets. Importantly, they are **namespaced**, so it's not possible to refer to a secret in one namespace, from a pod in **another** namespace. This restriction also applies to Ingress resources (*although there are workarounds*) - An Ingress can only refer to TLS secrets in its own namespace.

This behaviour can be prohibitive, because (a) we don't want to have to request/renew certificates for every single FQDN served by our cluster, and (b) we don't want more than one wildcard certificate if possible, to avoid being rate-limited at request/renewal time.

To take advantage of the various workarounds available, I find it best to put the certificates into a dedicated namespace, which I name.. `letsencrypt-wildcard-cert`.

!!! question "Why not the cert-manager namespace?"
    Because cert-manager is a _controller_, whose job it is to act on resources. I should be able to remove cert-manager entirely (even its namespace) from my cluster, and re-add it, without impacting the resources it acts upon. If the certificates lived in the `cert-manager` namespace, then I wouldn't be able to remove the namespace without also destroying the certificates.

## Preparation

### Namespace

We need a namespace to deploy our certificates and associated secrets into. Per the [flux design](/kubernetes/deployment/flux/), I create this in my flux repo at `flux-system/namespaces/namespace-letsencrypt-wildcard-cert.yaml`:

??? example "Example Namespace (click to expand)"
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
    name: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert
    ```

### Kustomization

Now we need a kustomization to tell Flux to install any YAMLs it finds in `/letsencrypt-wildcard-cert`. I create this Kustomization in my flux repo at `flux-system/kustomizations/kustomization-letsencrypt-wildcard-cert.yaml`.

!!! tip
    Importantly, note that we define a **dependsOn**, to tell Flux not to try to reconcile this kustomization before the cert-manager and sealedsecrets kustomizations are reconciled. Cert-manager creates the CRDs used to define certificates, so prior to Cert Manager being installed, the cluster won't know what to do with the ClusterIssuers/Certificate resources.

??? example "Example Kustomization (click to expand)"
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      interval: 15m
      path: ./letsencrypt-wildcard-cert
      dependsOn:
      - name: "cert-manager"
      - name: "sealed-secrets"
      prune: true # remove any elements later removed from the above path
      timeout: 2m # if not set, this defaults to interval duration, which is 1h
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository
        name: flux-system
      validation: server
    ```

### DNS01 Validation Secret

The simplest way to validate ownership of a domain to LetsEncrypt is to use DNS-01 validation. In this mode, we "prove" our ownership of a domain name by creating a special TXT record, which LetsEncrypt will check and confirm for validity, before issuing us any certificates for that domain name.

The [ClusterIssuers we created earlier](/kubernetes/ssl-certificates/letsencrypt-issuers/) included a field `solvers.dns01.cloudflare.apiTokenSecretRef.name`. This value points to a secret (*in the same namespace as the certificate[^1]*) containing credentials necessary to create DNS records automatically. (*again, my examples are for cloudflare, but the [other supported providers](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/) will have similar secret requirements*)

Thanks to [Sealed Secrets](/kubernetes/sealed-secrets/), we have a safe way of committing secrets into our repository, so to create necessary secret, you'd run something like this:

```bash
  kubectl create secret generic cloudflare-api-token-secret \
  --namespace letsencrypt-wildcard-cert \
  --dry-run=client \
  --from-literal=api-token=gobbledegook -o json \
  | kubeseal --cert <path to public cert> \
  | kubectl create -f - \
  > <path to repo>/letsencrypt-wildcard-cert/sealedsecret-cloudflare-api-token-secret.yaml
```

### Staging Certificate

Finally, we create our certificates! Here's an example certificate resource which uses the letsencrypt-staging issuer (*to avoid being rate-limited while learning!*). I save this in my flux repo as `/letsencrypt-wildcard-cert/certificate-wildcard-cert-letsencrypt-staging.yaml`

???+ example "Example certificate requested from LetsEncrypt staging"

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert-example.com-staging
      namespace: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert
    spec:
    # secretName doesn't have to match the certificate name, but it may as well, for simplicity!
    secretName: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert-example.com-staging 
    issuerRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging
      kind: ClusterIssuer
    dnsNames:
      - "example.com"
      - "*.example.com"
    ```

## Serving

### Did it work?

After committing the above to the repo, provided the YAML syntax is correct, you should end up with a "Certificate" resource in the `letsencrypt-wildcard-cert` namespace. This doesn't mean that the certificate has been issued by LetsEncrypt yet though - describe the certificate for more details, using `kubectl describe certificate -n letsencrypt-wildcard-cert letsencrypt-wildcard-cert-staging`. The `status` field will show you whether the certificate is issued or not:

```yaml
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2021-11-19T01:09:32Z
    Message:               Certificate is up to date and has not expired
    Observed Generation:   1
    Reason:                Ready
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
  Not After:               2022-02-17T00:09:26Z
  Not Before:              2021-11-19T00:09:27Z
  Renewal Time:            2022-01-18T00:09:26Z
  Revision:                1
```

### Troubleshooting

If your certificate does not become `Ready` within a few minutes [^1], try watching the logs of cert-manager to identify the issue, using `kubectl logs -f -n cert-manager -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cert-manager`.

### Production Certificate

Once you know you can happily deploy a staging certificate, it's safe enough to attempt your "prod" certificate. I save this in my flux repo as `/letsencrypt-wildcard-cert/certificate-wildcard-cert-letsencrypt-prod.yaml`

???+ example "Example certificate requested from LetsEncrypt prod"

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert-example.com
      namespace: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert
    spec:
    # secretName doesn't have to match the certificate name, but it may as well, for simplicity!
    secretName: letsencrypt-wildcard-cert-example.com 
    issuerRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
      kind: ClusterIssuer
    dnsNames:
      - "example.com"
      - "*.example.com"
    ```

Commit the certificate and follow the steps above to confirm that your prod certificate has been issued.
