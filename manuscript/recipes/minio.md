# Minio

Minio is a high performance distributed object storage server, designed for
large-scale private cloud infrastructure.

However, at its simplest, Minio allows you to expose a local filestructure via the [Amazon S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html). You could, for example, use it to provide access to "buckets" (folders) of data on your filestore, secured by access/secret keys, just like AWS S3. You can further interact with your "buckets" with common tools, just as if they were hosted on S3.

Under a more advanced configuration, Minio runs in distributed mode, with [features](https://www.minio.io/features.html) including high-availability, mirroring, erasure-coding, and "bitrot detection".

Possible use-cases:

1. Sharing files (_protected by user accounts with secrets_) via HTTPS, either as read-only or read-write, in such a way that the bucket could be mounted to a remote filesystem using common S3-compatible tools, like [goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys). Ever wanted to share a folder with friends, but didn't want to open additional firewall ports etc?
2. Simulating S3 in a dev environment
3. Mirroring an S3 bucket locally

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

We'll need a directory to hold our minio file store. You can create a blank directory wherever you like (*I used `/var/data/minio`*), or point the `/data` volume to a pre-existing folder structure.

```bash
mkdir /var/data/minio
```

### Prepare environment

Create `minio.env`, and populate with the variables below.

```bash
MINIO_ROOT_USER=hackme
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=becauseiforgottochangethepassword
MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL=https://minio-console.example.com
MINIO_SERVER_URL=https://minio.example.com
```

!!! note "If minio redirects you to :9001"
    `MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL` is especially important since recent versions of Minio will redirect web browsers to this URL when they hit the API directly. (*If you find yourself redirected to `http://your-minio-url:9001`, then you've not set this value correctly!*)

### Setup Docker Swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

--8<-- "premix-cta.md"

```yaml
version: '3.2'

services:
  app:
    image: minio/minio
    env_file: /var/data/config/minio/minio.env
    volumes:
     - /var/data/minio:/data
    networks:
      - traefik_public
    deploy:
      labels:
        # traefik
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.docker.network=traefik_public 

        # traefikv1
        - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:minio.example.com
        - traefik.port=9000   

        - traefik.console.frontend.rule=Host:minio-console.example.com
        - traefik.console.port=9001 

        # traefikv2 (death-by-labels, much?)
        - traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-https.redirectScheme.scheme=https
        - traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-https.redirectScheme.permanent=true

        - traefik.http.routers.minio-https.rule=Host(`minio.example.com`)
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-https.entrypoints=https
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-https.service=minio
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-http.rule=Host(`minio.example.com`)
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-http.entrypoints=http
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-http.middlewares=redirect-https
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-http.service=minio
        - traefik.http.services.minio.loadbalancer.server.port=9000

        - traefik.http.routers.minio-console-https.rule=Host(`minio-console.example.com`)
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-console-https.entrypoints=https
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-console-https.service=minio-console
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-console-http.rule=Host(`minio-console.example.com`)
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-console-http.entrypoints=http
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-console-http.middlewares=redirect-https
        - traefik.http.routers.minio-console-http.service=minio-console
        - traefik.http.services.minio-console.loadbalancer.server.port=9001

    command:  minio server /data --console-address ":9001"

networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true

```

## Serving

### Launch Minio stack

Launch the Minio stack by running ``docker stack deploy minio -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>`

Log into your new instance at `https://minio-console.**YOUR-FQDN**`, with the root user and password you specified in `minio.env`.

If you created `/var/data/minio`, you'll see nothing. If you mapped `/data` to existing data, you should see all subdirectories in your existing folder represented as buckets.

Use the Minio console to create a user, or (*ill-advisedly*) continue using the root user/password!

If all you need is single-user access to your data, you're done! ðŸŽ‰

If, however, you want to expose data to multiple users, at different privilege levels, you'll need the minio client to create some users and (_potentially_) policies...

## Minio Trickz :clown:

### Setup minio client

While it's possible to fully administer Minio using the console, it's also possible using the `mc` CLI client, as illustrated below

```bash
root@ds1:~# mc config host add minio http://app:9000 admin iambatman
mc: Configuration written to `/root/.mc/config.json`. Please update your access credentials.
mc: Successfully created `/root/.mc/share`.
mc: Initialized share uploads `/root/.mc/share/uploads.json` file.
mc: Initialized share downloads `/root/.mc/share/downloads.json` file.
Added `minio` successfully.
root@ds1:~#
```

### Add (readonly) user

Use mc to add a (readonly or readwrite) user, by running ```mc admin user add minio <access key> <secret key> <access level>```

Example:

```bash
root@ds1:~# mc admin user add minio spiderman peterparker readonly
Added user `spiderman` successfully.
root@ds1:~#
```

Confirm by listing your users (_admin is excluded from the list_):

```bash
root@node1:~# mc admin user list minio
enabled    spiderman             readonly
root@node1:~#
```

### Make a bucket accessible to users

By default, all buckets have no "policies" attached to them, and so can only be accessed by the administrative user. Having created some readonly/read-write users above, you'll be wanting to grant them access to buckets.

The simplest permission scheme is "on or off". Either a bucket has a policy, or it doesn't. (_I believe you can apply policies to subdirectories of buckets in a more advanced configuration_)

After **no** policy, the most restrictive policy you can attach to a bucket is "download". This policy will allow authenticated users to download contents from the bucket. Apply the "download" policy to a bucket by running ```mc policy download minio/<bucket name>```, i.e.:

```bash
root@ds1:# mc policy download minio/comics
Access permission for `minio/comics` is set to `download`
root@ds1:#
```

### Advanced bucketing

There are some clever complexities you can achieve with user/bucket policies, including:

* A public bucket, which requires no authentication to read or even write (_for a public dropbox, for example_)
* A special bucket, hidden from most users, but available to VIP users by application of a custom "[canned policy](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-multi-user-quickstart-guide.html)"

### Mount a minio share remotely

Having setup your buckets, users, and policies - you can give out your minio external URL, and user access keys to your remote users, and they can S3-mount your buckets, interacting with them based on their user policy (_read-only or read/write_)

I tested the S3 mount using [goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys), "a high-performance, POSIX-ish Amazon S3 file system written in Go".

First, I created ~/.aws/credentials, as follows:

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id=spiderman
aws_secret_access_key=peterparker
```

And then I ran (_in the foreground, for debugging_), `goofys --f -debug_s3 --debug_fuse --endpoint=https://traefik.example.com <bucketname> <local mount point>`

To permanently mount an S3 bucket using goofys, I'd add something like this to /etc/fstab:

```bash
goofys#bucket   /mnt/mountpoint        fuse     _netdev,allow_other,--file-mode=0666    0       0
```

[^1]: There are many S3-filesystem-mounting tools available, I just picked Goofys because it's simple. Google is your friend :)
[^2]: Some applications (_like [NextCloud](/recipes/nextcloud/)_) can natively mount S3 buckets
[^3]: Some backup tools (_like [Duplicity](/recipes/duplicity/)_) can backup directly to S3 buckets
