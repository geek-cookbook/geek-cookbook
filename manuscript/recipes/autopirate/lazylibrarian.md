# LazyLibrarian

!!! warning
    This is not a complete recipe - it's a component of the [autopirate](/recipes/autopirate/) "_uber-recipe_", but has been split into its own page to reduce complexity.

[LazyLibrarian](https://github.com/DobyTang/LazyLibrarian) is a tool to follow authors and grab metadata for all your digital reading needs. It uses a combination of Goodreads Librarything and optionally GoogleBooks as sources for author info and book info. Features include:

* Find authors and add them to the database
* List all books of an author and mark ebooks or audiobooks as 'wanted'.
* When processing the downloaded books it will save a cover picture (if available) and save all metadata into metadata.opf next to the bookfile (calibre compatible format)
* AutoAdd feature for book management tools like Calibre which must have books in flattened directory structure, or use calibre to import your books into an existing calibre library
* LazyLibrarian can also be used to search for and download magazines, and monitor for new issues

[^2]: The calibre-server container co-exists within the Lazy Librarian (LL) containers so that LL can automatically add a book to Calibre using the calibre-server interface. The calibre library can then be properly viewed using the [calibre-web](/recipes/calibre-web) recipe.
