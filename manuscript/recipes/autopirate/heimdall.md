# Heimdall

!!! warning
    This is not a complete recipe - it's a component of the [autopirate](/recipes/autopirate/) "_uber-recipe_", but has been split into its own page to reduce complexity.

[Heimdall Application Dashboard](https://heimdall.site/) is a dashboard for all your web applications. It doesn't need to be limited to applications though, you can add links to anything you like.

Heimdall is an elegant solution to organise all your web applications. It’s dedicated to this purpose so you won’t lose your links in a sea of bookmarks.

Heimdall provides a single URL to manage access to all of your autopirate tools, and includes "enhanced" (_i.e., display stats within Heimdall without launching the app_) access to [NZBGet][nzbge], [SABnzbd][nzbget], and friends.
