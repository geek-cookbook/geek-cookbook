    This is not a complete recipe - it's a component of the [AutoPirate](/recipes/autopirate/) "_uber-recipe_", but has been split into its own page to reduce complexity.


# Sonarr

[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) is a tool for finding, downloading and managing your TV series.

!!! tip "Sponsored Project"
    Sonarr is one of my [sponsored projects](/sponsored-projects/) - a project I financially support on a regular basis because of its utility to me. I forget it's there until I (reliably) receive an email with new and exciting updates 😁

## Inclusion into AutoPirate

To include Sonarr in your [AutoPirate](/recipes/autopirate/) stack, include the following in your autopirate.yml stack definition file:

````

  env_file : /var/data/config/autopirate/sonarr.env
  volumes:
   - /var/data/autopirate/sonarr:/config
   - /var/data/media:/media
  networks:
  - internal

sonarr_proxy:

## Assemble more tools..

Continue through the list of tools below, adding whichever tools your want to use, and finishing with the **[end](/recipes/autopirate/end/)** section:

* [SABnzbd](/recipes/autopirate/sabnzbd.md)
* [NZBGet](/recipes/autopirate/nzbget.md)
* [RTorrent](/recipes/autopirate/rtorrent/)
* Sonarr (this page)
* [Radarr](/recipes/autopirate/radarr/)
* [Mylar](/recipes/autopirate/mylar/)
* [Lazy Librarian](/recipes/autopirate/lazylibrarian/)
* [Headphones](/recipes/autopirate/headphones/)
* [Lidarr](/recipes/autopirate/lidarr/)
* [NZBHydra](/recipes/autopirate/nzbhydra/)
* [NZBHydra2](/recipes/autopirate/nzbhydra2/)
* [Ombi](/recipes/autopirate/ombi/)
* [Jackett](/recipes/autopirate/jackett/)
* [Heimdall](/recipes/autopirate/heimdall/)
* [End](/recipes/autopirate/end/) (launch the stack)

[^1]: In many cases, tools will integrate with each other. I.e., Radarr needs to talk to SABnzbd and NZBHydra, Ombi needs to talk to Radarr, etc. Since each tool runs within the stack under its own name, just refer to each tool by name (i.e. "radarr"), and docker swarm will resolve the name to the appropriate container. You can identify the tool-specific port by looking at the docker-compose service definition.
