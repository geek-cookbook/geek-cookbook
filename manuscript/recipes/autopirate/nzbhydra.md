# NZBHydra 2

!!! warning
    This is not a complete recipe - it's a component of the [AutoPirate](/recipes/autopirate/) "_uber-recipe_", but has been split into its own page to reduce complexity.

[NZBHydra 2](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2) is a meta search for NZB indexers. It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers. You can search all your indexers from one place and use it as an indexer source for tools like Sonarr, Radarr or CouchPotato.

Features include:

- Searches Anizb, BinSearch, NZBIndex and any newznab compatible indexers. Merges all results, filters them by a number of configurable restrictions, recognizes duplicates and returns them all in one place
- Add results to [NZBGet][nzbget] or [SABnzbd][sabnzbd]
- Support for all relevant media IDs (IMDB, TMDB, TVDB, TVRage, TVMaze) and conversion between them
- Query generation, meaning a query will be generated if only a media ID is provided in the search and the indexer doesn't support the ID or if no results were found
- Compatible with [Sonarr][sonarr], [Radarr][radarr], [NZBGet][nzbget], [SABnzbd][sabnzbd], nzb360, CouchPotato, [Mylar][mylar], [Lazy Librarian][lazylibrarian], Sick Beard, [Jackett][jackett], Watcher, etc.
- Search and download history and extensive stats. E.g. indexer response times, download shares, NZB age, etc.
- Authentication and multi-user support
- Automatic update of NZB download status by querying configured downloaders
- RSS support with configurable cache times
- Torrent support (_Although I prefer [Jackett][jackett] for this_):
  - For GUI searches, allowing you to download torrents to a blackhole folder
  - A separate Torznab compatible endpoint for API requests, allowing you to merge multiple trackers
- Extensive configurability
- Migration of database and settings from v1
