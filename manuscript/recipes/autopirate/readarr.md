# Readarr

!!! warning
    This is not a complete recipe - it's a component of the [AutoPirate](/recipes/autopirate/) "_uber-recipe_", but has been split into its own page to reduce complexity.

[Readarr](https://github.com/Readarr/Readarr), in the fine tradition of [Radarr][radarr] and [Sonarr][sonarr], is a tool for "sourcing" eBooks, using usenet or bittorrent indexers.

Features include:

* Support for major platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi, etc.
* Automatically detects new books
* Can scan your existing library and download any missing books
* Automatic failed download handling will try another release if one fails
* Manual search so you can pick any release or to see why a release was not downloaded automatically
* Fully configurable book renaming
* Full integration with [SABnzbd][sabnzbd] and [NZBGet][sabnzbd]
* Full integration with [Calibre][calibre-web] (add to library, conversion)
* And a beautiful UI!
