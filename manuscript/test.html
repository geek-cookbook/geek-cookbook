<h1 id="phpipam">phpIPAM</h1>
<p>phpIPAM is an open-source web IP address management application (<em>IPAM</em>). Its goal is to provide light, modern and useful IP address management. It is php-based application with MySQL database backend, using jQuery libraries, ajax and HTML5/CSS3 features.</p>

<p>phpIPAM fulfils a non-sexy, but important role - It helps you manage your IP address allocation.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-care-about-this">Why should you care about this?</h2>
<p>You probably have a home network, with 20-30 IP addresses, for your family devices, your <img src="/recipe/home-assistant" alt="IoT devices" />, your smart TV, etc. If you want to (a) monitor them, and (b) audit who does what, you care about what IPs they’re assigned by your DHCP server.</p>
<p>You could simple keep track of all devices with leases in your DHCP server, but what happens if your (<em>hypothetical?</em>) Ubiquity Edge Router X crashes and burns due to lack of disk space, and you loose track of all your leases? Well, you have to start from scratch, is what!</p>
<p>And that <a href="/recipes/homeassistant/">HomeAssistant</a> config, which you so carefully compiled, refers to each device by IP/DNS name, so you’d better make sure you recreate it consistently!</p>
<p>Enter phpIPAM. A tool designed to help home keeps as well as large organisations keep track of their IP (<em>and VLAN, VRF, and AS number</em>) allocations.</p>

<h3 id="setup-data-locations">Setup data locations</h3>
<p>We’ll need several directories to bind-mount into our container, so create them in /var/data/phpipam:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /var/data/phpipam/databases-dump -p
mkdir /var/data/runtime/phpipam -p</code></pre>
<h3 id="prepare-environment">Prepare environment</h3>
<p>Create phpipam.env, and populate with the following variables</p>
<pre><code># Setup for github, phpipam application
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID=
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET=
OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET=

# For MariaDB/MySQL database
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=imtoosecretformyshorts
MYSQL_DATABASE=phpipam
MYSQL_USER=phpipam
MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret

# phpIPAM-specific variables
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_USER=phpipam
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_DB=phpipam
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_HOST=db

# For backup
BACKUP_NUM_KEEP=7
BACKUP_FREQUENCY=1d</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, create phpipam-backup.env, and populate with the following variables:</p>
<pre><code># For MariaDB/MySQL database
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=imtoosecretformyshorts
MYSQL_DATABASE=phpipam
MYSQL_USER=phpipam
MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret

# For backup

<h3 id="create-nginx.conf">Create nginx.conf</h3>
<p>I usually protect my stacks using an <a href="/reference/oauth_proxy/">oauth proxy</a> container in front of the app. This protects me from either accidentally exposing a platform to the world, or having a insecure platform accessed and abused.</p>
<p>In the case of phpIPAM, the oauth_proxy creates an additional complexity, since it passes the “Authorization” HTTP header to the phpIPAM container. phpIPAH then examines the header, determines that the provided username (<em>my email address associated with my oauth provider</em>) doesn’t match a local user account, and denies me access without the opportunity to retry.</p>
<p>The (<em>dirty</em>) solution I’ve come up with is to insert an Nginx instance in the path between the oauth_proxy and the phpIPAM container itself. Nginx can remove the authorization header, so that phpIPAM can prompt me to login with a web-based form.</p>
<p>Create /var/data/phpipam/nginx.conf as follows:</p>
<pre><code>upstream app-upstream {
    server app:80;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ~.;

    # Just redirect everything to the upstream
    # Yes, it&#39;s embarassing. We are just a mechanism to strip an AUTH header :(
    location ^~ / {
        proxy_pass http://app-upstream;
    proxy_set_header       Authorization &quot;&quot;;
    }

}</code></pre>

  # Wait, what? Why do we have an oauth_proxy _and_ an nginx frontend for a simple webapp?
  # Well, it&#39;s a long story. Basically, the phpipam container sees the &quot;auth&quot; headers passed by the
  # oauth_proxy, and decides to use these exclusively to authenticate users. So no web-based login form, just &quot;access denied&quot;
  # To work around this, we add nginx reverse proxy to the mix. A PITA, but an easy way to solve without altering the PHPIPAM code

<li>If you wanted to expose the phpIPAM UI directly, you could remove the oauth2_proxy and the nginx services from the design, and move the traefik_public-related labels directly to the phpipam container. You’d also need to add the traefik_public network to the phpipam container.</li>
