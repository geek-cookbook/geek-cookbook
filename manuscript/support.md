# Support

> "Excuse me... waiter, there's a bug in this recipe!"

How do you get support for these receipes? There are several options...

## Discord: Where the cool kids are

All the cool kids are hanging out in the [Discord server][1].

> "Eh? What's Discord? Get off my lawn, young whippersnappers!!"

Yeah, I know. I also thought Discord was just for the gamer kids, but it turns out it's great for a geeky community. Why? [Let me elucidate ya.][2]..

1. Native markdown for code blocks
2. Drag-drop screenshots
3. Costs nothing, no ads
4. Mobile notifications are reliable, individual channels mutable, etc

## Forums: Party like it's 1999

For community support and engagement, I've setup a [Discourse forum][3]. Using this as the primary means of topical discussions makes it easy to share recipes / experiences with future geeks.

## Discuss a recipe

Every recipe includes a section at the end for comments.

If you have a comment / question about a specific recipe, navigate to the recipe, scroll to the bottom, and add your comment. You'll be sent to the [kitchen][4] to post the actual comment, but it'll be visible beneath the recipe _and_ at the kitchen. (_To post, you'll need to sign in using OAuth from github, google, etc, or create a new account_)

## Request a recipe

I'd love to hear your ideas for more recipes. To request/suggest a recipe, create a new post in the [kitchen][5] with the details.

## Spit out a bug

Found a bug in your soup? Tell the chef by either:

1. Commenting on the recipe (see above), or
2. Submitting an issue against the github [repo][6]

## Tip the chef

### Buy my book 

I'm also writing the Geek Cookbook as a formal eBook, on Leanpub (https://leanpub.com/geeks-cookbook). Buy it for $0.99 (_which is really just a token gesture of support_) - you can get it for free (_in PDF, mobi, or epub format_), or pay me what you think it's worth!

### [Sponsor][7] / [Patreonize][8] me 

The best way to support this work is to become a [Sponsor]() (_GitHub_) or a [Patron][10] (_Patreon_). For as little as $5/month, you get:

* warm fuzzies,
* access to the pre-mix repo,
* an anonymous plug you can pull at any time,
* and a bunch more loot based on tier

.. and I get some pocket money every month to buy wine, cheese, and cryptocurrency!  

Impulsively **[click here (NOW quick do it!)][11]** to sponsor me, or instead thoughtfully and analytically review my GitHub profile **[here][12]** and make up your own mind.

### Engage me 

Need some Cloud / Microservices / DevOps / Infrastructure design work done? I'm a full-time [AWS-certified][13] consultant, this stuff is my bread and butter! :breadfork\_and\_knife: [Contact][14] me and let's talk!

### Discord

Come and hang out in Discord..
