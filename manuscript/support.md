## Discord: Where the cool kids are

All the cool kids are hanging out in the [Discord server](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz).

> "Eh? What's Discord? Get off my lawn, young whippersnappers!!"

Yeah, I know. I also thought Discord was just for the gamer kids, but it turns out it's great for a geeky community. Why? [Let me elucidate ya.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qHoSWxVqtE)..

1. Native markdown for code blocks
2. Drag-drop screenshots
3. Costs nothing, no ads
4. Mobile notifications are reliable, individual channels mutable, etc

## Forums: Party like it's 1999

For community support and engagement, I've setup a [Discourse forum](https://discourse.geek-kitchen.funkypenguin.co.nz/). Using this as the primary means of topical discussions makes it easy to share recipes / experiences with future geeks.

## Discuss a recipe

Every recipe includes a section at the end for comments.

If you have a comment / question about a specific recipe, navigate to the recipe, scroll to the bottom, and add your comment. You'll be sent to the [kitchen](https://discourse.geek-kitchen.funkypenguin.co.nz/) to post the actual comment, but it'll be visible beneath the recipe _and_ at the kitchen. (_To post, you'll need to sign in using OAuth from github, google, etc, or create a new account_)

## Request a recipe

I'd love to hear your ideas for more recipes. To request/suggest a recipe, create a new post in the [kitchen](https://discourse.geek-kitchen.funkypenguin.co.nz/) with the details.

## Spit out a bug

Found a bug in your soup? Tell the chef by either:

1. Commenting on the recipe (see above), or
2. Submitting an issue against the github [repo](https://github.com/funkypenguin/geek-cookbook/issues)

## Tip the chef

### Buy my book 

I'm also writing the Geek Cookbook as a formal eBook, on Leanpub (https://leanpub.com/geeks-cookbook). Buy it for $0.99 (_which is really just a token gesture of support_) - you can get it for free (_in PDF, mobi, or epub format_), or pay me what you think it's worth!
