# Discord

The most realtime and exciting way engage with our geeky community is in our [Discord server](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz)

!!! question "Eh? What's a Discord? Get off my lawn, young whippersnappers!!"

Yeah, I know. I also thought Discord was just for the gamer kids, but it turns out it's great for a geeky community. Why? [Let me elucidate ya.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qHoSWxVqtE)..

1. Native markdown for code blocks
2. Drag-drop screenshots
3. Costs nothing, no ads
4. Mobile notifications are reliable, individual channels mutable, etc

## How do I suggest something?

3. In any channel, type `!suggest [your suggestion goes here]`. A post will be created in #in-flight for other users to vote on your suggestion. Suggestions change color as more users vote on them.
4. When your suggestion is completed (*or a decision has been made*), you'll receive a DM from carl-bot
