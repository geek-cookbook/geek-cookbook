Here's a [113-second video](https://static.funkypenguin.co.nz/how-to-contribute-to-geek-cookbook-quick-pr.mp4) illustrating the process!

## Contributing recipes 🎁

Want to contributing an entirely new recipe! Awesome!

The process is basically:

1. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone your forked repo locally
3. Make a new branch for your recipe (*not strictly necessary, but it helps to differentiate multiple in-flight recipes*)
4. Create your new recipe as a markdown file within the existing structure of the [manuscript folder](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/tree/master/manuscript) 
5. Add your recipe to the navigation by editing [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/blob/master/mkdocs.yml#L32)
6. Test locally by running `./scripts/serve.sh` in the repo folder (*this launches a preview in Docker*), and navigating to http://localhost:8123
7. Rinse and repeat until you're ready to submit a PR
8. Create a pull request via the GitHub UI
9. The pull request will trigger the creation of a preview environment, as illustrated below. Use the deploy preview to confirm that your recipe is as tasty as possible!
