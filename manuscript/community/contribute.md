## Contributing bugfixorz üêõ

Found a typo / error in a recipe? Each recipe includes a link to make the fix, directly on GitHub:

Click the link to edit the recipe in Markdown format, and save to create a pull request!

Here's a [113-second video](https://static.funkypenguin.co.nz/how-to-contribute-to-geek-cookbook-quick-pr.mp4) illustrating the process!

## Contributing recipes üéÅ

Want to contributing an entirely new recipe? Awesome!

For the best experience, start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/issues/) in the repo (*check whether an existing issue for this recipe exists too!*). Populating the issue template will flesh out the requirements for the recipe, and having the new recipe pre-approved will avoid wasted effort if the recipe _doesn't_ meet requirements for addition, for some reason (*i.e., if it's been superceded by an existing recipe*)

Once your issue has been reviewed and approved, start working on a PR using either GitHub Codespaces or local dev (below). As soon as you're ready to share your work, create a WIP PR, so that a preview URL will be generated. Iterate on your PR, marking it as ready for review when it's ... ready :grin:

### üèÜ GitPod

GitPod  (free up to 50h/month) is by far the smoothest and most slick way to edit the cookbook. Click [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook) to launch a browser-based editing session! ü•∑

### ü•à GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (_no longer free now that it's out of beta_) provides a browser-based VSCode interface, pre-configured for your development environment. For no-hassle contributions to the cookbook with realtime previews, visit the [repo](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook), and when clicking the download button (*where you're usually get the URL to clone a repo*), click on "**Open with CodeSpaces**" instead:

![How to use GitHub Codespaces](https://static.funkypenguin.co.nz/2021/geek-cookbookgeek-cookbook_The_Geeks_Cookbook_is_a_collection_of_guides_for_establishing_your_own_highly-available_privat_2021-01-07_11-41-25.png)

You'll shortly be dropped into the VSCode interface, with mkdocs/material pre-installed and running. Any changes you make are auto-saved (*there's no "Save" button*), and available in the port-forwarded preview within seconds:

![Launching preview in port-forwarded tab](https://static.funkypenguin.co.nz/2021/contribute.md__geek-cookbook_Codespaces__Visual_Studio_Code_-_Insiders__Codespaces_2021-01-07_11-50-25.png)

Once happy with your changes, drive VSCode as normal to create a branch, commit, push, and create a pull request. You can also abandon the browser window at any time, and return later to pick up where you left off (*even on a different device!*)

### ü•â Editing locally

The process is basically:

1. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone your forked repo locally
3. Make a new branch for your recipe (*not strictly necessary, but it helps to differentiate multiple in-flight recipes*)
4. Create your new recipe as a markdown file within the existing structure of the [manuscript folder](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/tree/master/manuscript)
5. Add your recipe to the navigation by editing [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/geek-cookbook/geek-cookbook/blob/master/mkdocs.yml#L32)
6. Test locally by running `./scripts/serve.sh` in the repo folder (*this launches a preview in Docker*), and navigating to <http://localhost:8123>
7. Rinse and repeat until you're ready to submit a PR
8. Create a pull request via the GitHub UI
9. The pull request will trigger the creation of a preview environment, as illustrated below. Use the deploy preview to confirm that your recipe is as tasty as possible!
