# Welcome to Funky Penguin's Geek Cookbook

## Hello world,

I'm [David](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/).

I'm a contracting IT consultant, with a broad range of experience and skills. I'm an [AWS Certified Solution Architect (Professional)](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=4&t=c&d=2019-02-22&ci=AWS00794574), a remote worker, I've had a [book published](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/phplist-2-email-campaign-manager/), and I [blog](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/) on topics that interest me.

## Why Funky Penguin?

My first "real" job, out of high-school, was working the IT helpdesk in a typical pre-2000 organization in South Africa. I enjoyed experimenting with Linux, and cut my teeth by replacing the organization's Exchange 5.5 mail platform with a 15-site [qmail-ldap](http://www.nrg4u.com/) cluster, with [amavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amavis) virus-scanning.

One of our suppliers asked me to quote to do the same for their organization. With nothing to loose, and half-expecting to be turned down, I quoted a generous fee, and chose a cheeky company name. The supplier immediately accepted my quote, and the name ("_Funky Penguin_") stuck.

## Technical Documentation

During the same "real" job above, I wanted to deploy [jabberd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberd14), for internal instant messaging within the organization, and as a means to control the sprawl of ad-hoc instant-messaging among staff, using ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo Messenger.

To get management approval to deploy, I wrote a logger (with web UI) for jabber conversations ([Bandersnatch](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/project/bandersnatch/)), and a [75-page user manual](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/jajc-manual/) (_in [Docbook XML](http://www.docbook.org/)_) for a spunky Russian WinXP jabber client, [JAJC](http://jajc.jrudevels.org/).

Due to my contributions to [phpList](http://www.phplist.com), I was approached in 2011 by [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com), to [write a book](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/phplist-2-email-campaign-manager) about using PHPList.

!!! quote "He unblocked me on all the technical hurdles to launching my SaaS in GKE!"

    By the time I had enlisted Funky Penguin's help, I'd architected myself into a bit of a nightmare with Kubernetes. I knew what I wanted to achieve, but I'd made a mess of it. Funky Penguin (David) was able to jump right in and offer a vital second-think on everything I'd done, pointing out where things could be simplified and streamlined, and better alternatives. 

    He unblocked me on all the technical hurdles to launching my SaaS in GKE! 

    With him delivering the container/Kubernetes architecture and helm CI/CD workflow, I was freed up to focus on coding and design, which fast-tracked me to launching on time. And now I have a simple deployment process that is easy for me to execute and maintain as a solo founder. 

    I have no hesitation in recommending him for your project, and I'll certainly be calling on him again in the future.
